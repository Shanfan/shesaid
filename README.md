She Said
=======
=======



“She said,” collects humorous quotes from Sex and the City TV series. The main design concern here is the fluid typography. I’d like each quote to be presented like on a flashcard. The ideal presentation shall have every quote fit right into the window. Currently there’s a function that calculate the length of each quote, then scale the font size up or down accordingly. This demo still needs some fine tuning to get a smooth result.  

For the demo I hand picked the quotes and stored them in a Javascript array, then wrote the sorting and filtering functions for display. For the final implementation I might make it into a Tumblr theme, so it could benefit from the powerful blogging platform. But things are up in the air right now. 

Need: 
* Better transition in between the quotes
* backend stuff (hope to provide submit form)
* Share and like functions
